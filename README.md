# Deployment

- Throughout the project, I committed changes using these steps: "git add ." --> "git commit -m "message"" --> "git push".

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. **The steps I took to achieve this were:**

Go to the settings in the GitHub repository.

Navigate your way to the pages section which should be the last tab on the left under Code and Automation.

Make sure the source is Deploy from a branch.

Set the branch to "main" and click save.

# Credits 

 - My mentor Spencer for his patience and guidance.
